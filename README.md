This is a project based on Type Script using React JS in order to create a responsive Theme Switcher.

The first step is to create a new React app using create-react-app and the Type Script template (--template=typescript)

I used some libraries and websites in order to work with colors and displays

The first repository used was React-Switch, used to created a pre assembled structure and properties for the switch component

##Styled-components is used to work in the CSS while dinamic changing the app's styles

For matching colors and paletes, I used coolors.com

The goal of this project is for self education, so leave a coment or contribute in order to evolve faster and better with me.
